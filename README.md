# IPL_Analytics_Excel_Project

IPL Analytics Dashboard | Microsoft Excel | Excel BI Dashboard

Objective: To analyze IPL team performance, toss impact, and player dominance across 11 seasons (2008-2018) using Excel-based analytics and visualization tools.

I created analytical dashboard to explore IPL team performance, toss decisions, venues, and player impact across all seasons from 2008 to 2018 — built entirely in Microsoft Excel using Power Query, Pivot Charts, and interactive filters.

Key Insights:
• Mumbai Indians and Chennai Super Kings dominated with the highest total wins (both showing consistent top performance in both batting and fielding first scenarios).
• Teams winning the toss and choosing to field had a 59% higher win rate, proving the strategic advantage of chasing in IPL conditions.
• M. Chinnaswamy Stadium (Bangalore) and Eden Gardens (Kolkata) hosted the most matches, with field-first teams winning more often — highlighting ground-specific trends.
• CH Gayle emerged as the most frequent Man of the Match winner (20 awards), followed closely by AB de Villiers (18) and YK Pathan (16) — emphasizing consistent player impact.
• CSK and MI have each clinched 3 IPL titles, showing long-term dominance, while KKR followed with 2 titles.
• Teams batting second won 59% of matches — chasing remains the winning strategy.
• Mumbai Indians & Chennai Super Kings lead the league with 3 titles each.
• CH Gayle is the top Man of the Match winner (20 times).
• M. Chinnaswamy Stadium saw the most matches played (and most wins when fielding first).

Tools Used:
• Power Query for data cleaning & transformation
• Pivot Charts & Slicers for interactive exploration
• Custom color palette & KPIs for storytelling
